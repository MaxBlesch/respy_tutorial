This is a short introduction to respy for new users. As economists love Robinsonades 1, we will showcase the implementation of a Robinson Crusoe economy as a discrete choice dynamic programming model. Throughout the notebook you find indented texts which make you familiar with Robinsonâ€™s story. We will first set the scene with a broad introduction and then turn to the precise model specification. We continue by simulating the model and analyze its comparative statics.
